negative,"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
negative,@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail

negative,"@SouthwestAir pls help me get this resolved &amp; reimbursement made.  gracias, rico; pls send me private msg with phone number or email address"
negative,@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
negative,@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
negative,@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
positive,@AmericanAir AA2416 on time and awesome flight. Great job American!
negative,@AmericanAir half hour Late Flight leaving DFW...no attempt at an explanation
positive,@SouthwestAir thank you for the confirmation. Maybe people on my flight have directional dislexia.
negative,"@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?"
negative,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
negative,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
negative,nope. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/9SHhTvIOTI
negative,@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible

negative,@USAirways can't get back lost time
negative,@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
negative,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first

negative,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
negative,@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.

negative,@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.

negative,@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
negative,@AmericanAir its now 17 days since I contacted customer relations... #surf #fail #BaggageDrama http://t.co/CS1673hrqQ
negative,"@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right."
negative,"@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral."
negative,@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
negative,@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
negative,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
negative,"@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks."
positive,@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
negative,"@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage"
negative,delete your account @JetBlue
negative,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
positive,@JetBlue yes! Terra blue chips were my favorite. :)
negative,"@USAirways flight today Cancelled Flighted  in phl, dozens of other flights still going. On hold for 3hrs. I need to get to my job interview!!!"
negative,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
negative,@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
negative,"@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again."

negative,"@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up."
negative,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
negative,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting

negative,@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
negative,@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
negative,@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
negative,@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
negative,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
negative,@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
negative,@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
positive,"@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy."
negative,@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
negative,"@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in."
negative,@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
negative,"@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch"
negative,@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
negative,"@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks"
negative,@united I think DM would be better
negative,@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
negative,@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
positive,@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
negative,"@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!"
negative,"@USAirways I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash."
negative,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
negative,"@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625"
positive,‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/3kVkd8yRxa‚Äù + lol wow
negative,".@USAirways trying to get a partner PNR, and have spent more than 1 hour on hold.  I know its snowing somewhere, but this is awful"
negative,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
negative,"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
negative,@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
negative,@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag
negative,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
negative,"@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned."
negative,@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!
negative,@USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags!
negative,@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
negative,"@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help"
negative,"@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week."
negative,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
negative,@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
negative,@AmericanAir 249 EWR - DFW is now stopping BNA to refuel 4 bad weather? Are YOU just trying to get the plane closer 2 DFW then Cancelled Flight on us?
negative,"@USAirways can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc"
negative,@USAirways where's my apology?
negative,@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
negative,"@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!"
negative,@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
positive,@SouthwestAir @bgr1061 luv SWA myself and my employees use you always!!
negative,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
negative,"@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?"
negative,"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
negative,"@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough"
positive,Yes!! Thanks so much!!! üíú‚Äú@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY‚Äù

negative,@USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again
negative,@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
negative,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
negative,"@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again."
positive,@VirginAmerica thanks for the free birthday points! y'all are ALL RIGHT with me!
negative,@SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight
negative,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
positive,@USAirways Mellani B. and whole team in Columbia SC are absolute superstars. Incredibly helpful.
negative,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
negative,"@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!"
negative,@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
negative,@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated
negative,"@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?"
positive,.@JetBlue 4 min response time. I'm impressed! I'm in. It's official.  :-) #trueblue  JetBlue gets social.
negative,@VirginAmerica on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline.
negative,@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
positive,@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
positive,Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
negative,@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
negative,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
positive,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
negative,@AmericanAir That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now???
positive,@united @suntoshi I still like you united airlines
positive,@SouthwestAir just had a great flight #4223 with Damion! He was the best #damionflight4223
negative,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
negative,@USAirways Hey. I hve Cancelled Flightled flght &amp; on hold for 30 min nw 4 rebook. Website not working. Can u give me some insight if I DM conf #?
negative,@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
negative,"@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing."
negative,@USAirways If my flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled every week I might as well be in business class.
negative,"@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins"
negative,@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
negative,"@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours..."
negative,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
negative,@USAirways @PRof_Solutions Be prepared for 3+ hours hold times
negative,@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
negative,@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
negative,@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
negative,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
negative,@SouthwestAir Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can't book it online. When will this be available?

negative,@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
positive,@united thanks
negative,"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
negative,@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
negative,"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
positive,@JetBlue thank you!!
negative,Well @AmericanAir we won't be flying you. Rebooked on Jetblue. With credits (that actually work) it was free!

negative,@AmericanAir Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. http://t.co/I7Vdi9WqSF
negative,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
negative,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
negative,@USAirways not best pleased with service so far. On our third gate and still no guarantee that it's the correct one :(
negative,@JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR.

positive,@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV but of course! :-) #bestdressed #bluecarpet
negative,@JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
negative,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."

negative,@usairways you mean 10:30pm. I'd be in vegas by now if I'd been allowed on my original flight.
negative,@USAirways how do you manage to place a family of 5 into a plain with none of them sitting next to each other one of them being a 3yr old
negative,@VirginAmerica Already checked in so the page expired :X
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
negative,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
negative,"@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks."
negative,@AmericanAir How do I change my flight if the phone system keeps telling me that the representatives are busy?
negative,@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
positive,"@AmericanAir 

Fantastic support by the Twitter team. I appreciate it. Thanks again."

negative,"@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours."
negative,"@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it‚Äôs not 1997 anymore."
negative,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
positive,@VirginAmerica #thankyou the DAL-AUS route makes my day!!!!
negative,@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
positive,@JetBlue sounds good!!!üíôüíôüíôüíô

positive,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
negative,"@USAirways Will tweet all day until I get 
a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health."
negative,@SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ??
negative,@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
negative,"@united no announcement re extra baggage, ""find an empty bin"" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing"
negative,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
negative,@USAirways why have me board a plane knowing there is a maint issue?  US5235.
negative,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
negative,"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours"
negative,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
negative,".@united You may ""dislike delays"" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time."
negative,@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
negative,@JetBlue Why wasn't a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow?
positive,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
negative,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
negative,@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
negative,@JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me
negative,@JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
negative,"@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
negative,See what you started now @nytimes RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/atd2Sm8HF4
negative,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
negative,@SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
negative,@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
negative,"@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?"
negative,@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
positive,@united thanks for leaving our 3 year old in his own row flight 360 LAX-IAD
negative,@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
negative,@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
negative,@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
negative,"@JetBlue not to get into semantics here but ""by"" means ""within the extent or period of; during"" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary"
negative,@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
negative,@JetBlue You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!?  You're  now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list.
negative,"@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer"
negative,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
